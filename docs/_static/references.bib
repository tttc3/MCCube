  abstract  = {It is well known that there is a mathematical equivalence between 'solving' parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) and 'the integration' of certain functionals on Wiener space. Monte Carlo simulation of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) is a naive approach based on this underlying principle. In finite dimensions, it is well known that cubature can be a very effective approach to integration. We discuss the appropriate extension of this idea to Wiener space. In the process we develop high-order numerical schemes valid for high-dimensional SDEs and semi-elliptic PDEs.},
